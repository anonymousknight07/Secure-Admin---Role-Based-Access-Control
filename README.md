# Secure Admin - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard

Secure Admin is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** user interface designed to manage users, roles, and permissions dynamically. It showcases a secure, functional, and visually appealing dashboard with dark and light themes. The project includes user and role management, permission handling, and dynamic visualizations for system monitoring.
